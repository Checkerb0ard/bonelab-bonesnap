# ðŸ“· BoneSnap - A BONELAB Screenshotting Tool
[Thunderstore](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/Fizzyhex/BoneSnap) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Fizzyhex/bonelab-bonesnap)

Take screenshots your game window with ease, with no more 4:3 jpgs and fumbling around blindly for your keyboard! All captures are saved to your clipboard and the UserData\Screenshots folder.

## Compatibility

BoneSnap simply just takes a snapshot of your game window. In other words, the tool will work with camera mods (Cinematic Tools, GoPro, etc.) 

## Quality setting

BoneSnap will output as a lossless image (PNG) by default, but you can also reduce the quality and it'll output as a JPG instead.

## â™¥ Thanks

Hope you like the mod! Huge shoutout to trev and yellowyears for helping with debugging.
